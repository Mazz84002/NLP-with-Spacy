ML models 2 types
	pre-trained 
	custom - we train

ML phases
	train
		data - labeled/tagged	
		save model

	predict
		load model file make prediction


current entity extraction approach
	CRF + SPACY 2.2 + fasttext word2vec + feature creation (previous word + next word)

cons
	1. taking longer time for training

	fasttext - https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html


GOAL - 

	1. study topics
		ML - data labeling/tagging, training, prediction
		Entity extraction - CRF

		Word2Vec 
			word2vec (dict)- 3-5 million
			{
				"people":[1x300]
			}
			what is? 
			pros/cons
			Types:
				google - pretrained
				fasttext
				stanford - glove models
				gensim library - you can train your own word2vec mmodels

		advanced algos to wrod2vec - transformers (huggingface)

	2. figure out a way to train entity extraction model using => CRF + SPACY 3
	3. Also can we get good results with improved performance by replacing word2vec?2

spac2  + w2v => spacy 3 (transformers plugin) + transformer
