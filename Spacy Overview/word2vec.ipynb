    "- The model could be very difficult to train if use the softmax function, since the number of categories is too large (the size of vocabulary). Though approxination algorithms like negative sampling (NEG) and hierarchical softmax (HS) are proposed to address the issue, other problems happen. For example, the word vectors by NEG are not distributed uniformally, they are located within a cone in the vector space hence the vector space is not sufficiently utilized."
